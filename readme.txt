== HERE’S WHAT USERS SAY ABOUT  WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT CAROUSEL, SLIDER & GRID ULTIMATE ==

>👨 __this app and the support are first class__

>these guys were so helpful – i love the plugin and am using the free version; they still gave me support regardless 🙂
- By @esolutionsni

>💁 __FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WORKS!__

>I just started using this and it’s beautiful! It works exactly how it should and did exactly what I needed. I tried 3 other plugins like this and it was terrible. Finally I found the solution!
- By @jchretien

>👨 __Very Functional Plugin for displaying products__

>This plugin is an excellent addition to the Woocommerce product display. By allowing a Quick Look and a Favorites function it gives any site a professional look without all the programming. With the ability to utilize 15 different templates you can achieve just about any desired look in minutes. I purchased the multiple site license because I plan on using it on all my sites. My only suggestion is that it would be nice to be able to change and save the default settings to match personal tastes so you don’t have to change them with every new application. Other than that its a big bravo.
